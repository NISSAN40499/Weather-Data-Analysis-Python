# Weather Data Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing weather data. We explore various aspects of the dataset, including weather conditions, wind speed, visibility, and more.

Data Source:-
The weather data is sourced from the file `Wether data.csv`.

Analysis Highlights

1. Weather Condition Frequency
   - We examine the frequency of different weather conditions (e.g., "Mainly Clear," "Mostly Cloudy," etc.).
   - A bar chart visualizes the distribution.

2. Unique Wind Speeds
   - We calculate the number of unique wind speeds recorded.

3. Clear Weather Instances
   - We determine how many times the weather was clear.

4. Specific Wind Speed Count
   - We count occurrences when the wind speed was exactly 4 km/h.

5. Missing Data
   - We check for missing values in the dataset.

6. Mean Visibility
   - We calculate the average visibility.

7. Standard Deviation of Pressure
   - We compute the standard deviation of pressure (kPa).

8. Variance of Relative Humidity
   - We analyze the variance of relative humidity.

9. Snowy Weather Instances
   - We filter data for snowy weather conditions.

10. High Wind Speed Instances
    - We count instances where the wind speed was above 25 km/h.

11. Cloudy Weather with High Humidity
    - We find the number of times it was cloudy with relative humidity above 75%.

12. Minimum and Maximum Values
    - We determine the minimum and maximum values for each weather condition.

13. Foggy Weather Instances
    - We count instances of foggy weather.

14. Thunderstorms and Visibility
    - We explore thunderstorms with high humidity or low visibility.
